# 🤖 AI-Based Smart Internships Allocation System

## 📌 Overview

The **AI-Based Smart Internships Allocation System** is an intelligent, data-driven platform designed to automate and optimize the allocation of internships for students under large-scale programs such as the **Prime Minister’s Internship Scheme (PMIS)**. The system replaces traditional manual and biased allocation methods with an AI-powered engine that evaluates student profiles and internship requirements to ensure **fairness, transparency, efficiency, and accuracy**.

By leveraging artificial intelligence, machine learning, and predictive analytics, the platform computes a **Fit Meter Score** for each student–internship pair, enabling personalized, skill-based, and equitable internship matching.

## ❗ Problem Statement

Existing internship allocation systems suffer from:

* Manual and time-consuming allocation processes
* Bias and lack of transparency
* Poor skill–internship matching
* Absence of real-time monitoring
* Limited feedback and learning recommendations for students
* Insecure and fragmented data storage

These limitations lead to inefficient placements, reduced student satisfaction, and high administrative overhead.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Automate internship allocation using AI and machine learning
* Ensure fair and unbiased student–internship matching
* Reduce manual workload for administrators
* Provide real-time monitoring and analytics
* Offer personalized skill improvement recommendations
* Maintain secure, centralized, and cloud-independent data storage

---

## 🚀 Key Features

* **AI-Powered Allocation Engine** with Fit Meter scoring
* **Skill-Based Matching** using weighted evaluation
* **Real-Time Internship Availability Tracking**
* **Personalized Recommendations** for students
* **Role-Based Dashboards** for Students, Companies, and Administrators
* **Centralized Local Database** for secure data handling
* **Transparent and Explainable Allocation Process**

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The system is composed of the following core modules:

1. **Student & Internship Database**
   Stores student profiles and internship details securely in a centralized local database.

2. **AI Allocation Engine**
   Computes a Fit Meter Score for each student–internship pair using multiple weighted factors.

3. **Local Management Module**
   Manages real-time updates, access control, and data integrity.

4. **Monitoring & Analytics Module**
   Generates real-time statistics, performance metrics, and visual dashboards.

5. **User Interfaces**

   * Student Dashboard
   * Company Dashboard
   * Administrator Dashboard

## 📊 Fit Meter Scoring Algorithm

Each student–internship pair is evaluated on a **0–100 scale** using the following weighted criteria:

| Factor          | Description                                                | Weight |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| Skill Match     | Overlap between student skills and internship requirements | 60%    |
| Domain Match    | Preferred role/domain alignment                            | 15%    |
| Location Match  | Preferred vs offered location                              | 10%    |
| Stipend Match   | Expected vs offered stipend                                | 10%    |
| Internship Type | Remote / On-site / Hybrid preference                       | 5%     |
